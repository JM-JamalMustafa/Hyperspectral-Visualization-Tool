# Hyperspectral-Visualization-Tool
This project is an interactive web-based tool designed for visualizing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data. It allows users to explore and analyze HSI data by providing various visualization options, including spectral plots, RGB composites, and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) based visualizations.

# Features
Interactive Visualizations: Supports dynamic generation of spectral plots, RGB composites, and PCA visualizations from hyperspectral data cubes.
HSI Data Handling: Capable of loading and processing HSI data cubes with multiple spectral bands.
Customization Options: Users can select specific bands for RGB composites and adjust visualization parameters for better analysis.
PCA Visualization: Automatically applies PCA to reduce the dimensionality of HSI data, allowing users to visualize the most significant components.
Flask Web Framework: The tool is built using Flask, providing a simple and responsive user interface.
